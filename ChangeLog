	* DESCRIPTION (Version): Bumped the version number.

	* R/splines.R: Omitted "degree" from the list of arguments passed
	to ns in predict.ns.

	* src/splines.c (spline_value): Fixed position of the coefficient
	vector relative to the knots vector. (Actually undid my previous,
	incorrect "fix").
	(spline_basis): Changed from S_alloc to Calloc/Free.
	(spline_value): Changed from memcpy to Memcpy.

	* R/splineClasses.R: Fixed a long standing bug in
	predict.polySpline.  I used codes(cut(x,knots)) where I should
	have used as.numeric(cut(x,knots)).  Should have R'd the FM.  The
	interpSpline classes now provide interpolation splines.
	Before they did not.

	* R/splineClasses.R: Removed the now redundant definition of
	as.data.frame.data.frame

	* man/polySpline.Rd: Added points to all the plots of the
	interpolating splines in the examples.

	* man/splineOrder.Rd: Changed the call to interpSpline in the
	example to remove the "data =" on the second argument.  (Same
	change in splineKnots.) Should we modify the organization of
	interpSpline instead so there is a interpSpline generic with
	interpSpline.default and interpSpline.formula?
	
	* man/bs.Rd: Added a \dontrun because I don't know what the data
	should be.  Same for man/ns.Rd and predict.bs.Rd

	* GNUmakefile: Transferred the files to the Rlibs source directory
	(done by Saikat) and added the GNUmakefile.

	* R/splines.R: Bug fix in ns on nIknots due to Bill Venables.

1999-07-16  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/splines.R: Incorporated fixes from Martin Maechler for missing
	drop = FALSE that caused bs(..., degree = 1) to fail.  Cosmetic changes.

1998-06-30  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* Changed the source location from src-c to src.

	* Corrected some errors in the examples in the man pages.
